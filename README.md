# Gradio-GroundingDINO-Mac
This repository hosts a Gradio application that leverages PyTorch and the transformers library to perform zero-shot object detection using the grounding-dino-tiny model from IDEA-Research. The application is optimized to run on Mac silicon chips, ensuring efficient performance on Apple's M1 and M2 processors.
