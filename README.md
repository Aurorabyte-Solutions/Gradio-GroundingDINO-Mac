# Gradio-GroundingDINO-Mac
This repository hosts a Gradio application that leverages PyTorch and the transformers library to perform zero-shot object detection using the grounding-dino-tiny model from IDEA-Research. The application is enabled to run on Mac silicon chips, ensuring efficient performance on Apple silicon chips. Also can run with CPU or CUDA!

## Features:
Zero-Shot Object Detection: Utilize the state-of-the-art grounding-dino-tiny model to detect objects without the need for prior training on specific classes.
Gradio Interface: A user-friendly web interface for uploading images and viewing detection results in real-time.
Mac Silicon Optimization: Fully compatible and optimized for running on Mac silicon chips (M1, M2), leveraging their computational capabilities.
Easy Setup: Simple installation and setup process with detailed instructions to get you started quickly.
Installation:
Follow these steps to set up the application on your local machine:
